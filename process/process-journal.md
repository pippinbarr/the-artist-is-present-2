# Getting there, Sitting there, What is it about? (Wednesday, 21 August 2019, 14:44PM)

Okay then. I thought I would make a sequel to The Artist Is Present (the game) now, about nine years after I released the first one. Arguable the game that "made my name" or something along those lines. Still a game a bunch of people identify me with, having no conception that I made anything worthwhile after it. Ho ho.

The premise is simple. It's "the same game" but you're Marina instead of an audience member.

There are a bunch of decisions to be made chiefly around what it means to get to the performance, and then what the interface is like when you're in the performance.

## Getting there

I can think of a few gradations of detail here.

### You could just already be in the room right at the start of the game.

This wouldn't work at all though because it gives you no chance to embody your character as Marina, so it would just be disorienting and unclear.

### You could arrive at the museum just like an audience member (except earlier I suppose). Go in through the doors, say good morning to the people there, and then walk down the same hallways to get to your chair and sit down.

I like this one for mirroring the original game and lending a different feeling to the same actions that existed in that game. I guess I don't know how much I want to be referential to the original versus being authentic to the actual process by which Marina went to the performance? How authentic is this thing to be and in what ways?

In this version and any that don't have a changing room you'd already be in the red dress presumably, which I think would be nice and lend some humour to the experience.

### You could start at home and come to the museum from there (perhaps then cutting to the ideas in the previous one, so still coming the front doors etc.)

This was part of my vision for it when I was thinking of it a few days ago. In particular I wanted a kind of tribute to [Every Day the Same Dream](http://www.molleindustria.org/everydaythesamedream/everydaythesamedream.html). Start in the bedroom, go to the living room/kitchen, to the hallway with elevator (or stairs?), down to the street, into a car, arrive at MoMA, and carry on.

### I guess there's an ultra authentic version where I look at the footage available and try to actually recreate her path to MoMA and inside it, too

Which can work, too, but may not even be that rewarding. The authenticity isn't really meant to operate at the level of the architecture? Though I could certainly reference the actual apartment she was in (maybe a joke including passing through multiple living areas?) The ultra-authentic version would presumably involve dressing at the museum but I think it's too fun for her to dress at home.

### So something like

- Use reference images for EDTSD style sequence (in Sierra style art).
- Starts at home in bedroom.
- Maybe just by exiting she ends up in clothes. Otherwise by "using" the closet, but this raises the possibility of going naked, which is something else.
- Into living area. Maybe more than one.
- Kitchen area.
- Exit to hallway.
- Use elevator (if more referencing EDTSD), use stairs (if more referencing the actual apartment - also the hilarity of Sierra stairs).
- Street. Car waiting for her.
- Car takes her to MoMA. (Maybe a cut scene of being in the car for a set amount of time?)
- And from there follow the standard sequence. When you sit the queue forms? Or is it already there?

So yeah, question: is the queue already waiting and you arrive and sit and it begins, or there's no one, you sit, and then they come. There's something funnily vulnerable about there being nobody initially?

Also do I want to engage with questions of time this time? Or is it on "Marina time" so that when you get there, that's when it begins? I think I might prefer that?

## Sitting there

Until in the original game where sitting was the big reveal, here it's the majority of the experience I guess?

My thought is that it should simply bring up a blown up face of the person who sat down (literally scale it up) and that's it. They sit for however long they "want" to (match the timings of the original). THen they get up (maybe a nice tween) and you cut back to the main view and wait for the next one (head down). Maybe you choose when to raise your head actually, that would be nice. Will have to look at how I might include instructions for that kind of thing. (And actually if I do include an "action button" I could consider the wardrobe thing again - perhaps just not letting nude Marina leave since it's "not that kind of performance").

Honestly that bit doesn't sound all that incredibly difficult.

## So

There's a fair bit to think about clearly, and some new environments to create. I need to get Sierra-style-stuff working in Phaser3 (shouldn't be too bad given Eveline was in Phaser 2 I think).

Some open questions about authenticity of time and space.

Questions about interaction buttons and wardrobes.

## What is it about?

The key factor here is the question of what the game is "about", and I think it's about the experience of being Marina right? To which end I need to make decisions that focus on that. As such I don't think the time thing is at issue - we don't need to deal with concepts of her being "late" or whatever. It just starts when she sits. And lasts for however long it was meant to last (8 hours?).

The key is for the player to at some level build some identification with Marina as a brave/determined/lonely/independent figure (this being achieved through the sequence of arrival, which is probably why the apartment is so important). And then to identify with the act of endurance as almost secondary somehow, a matter of course, something you just do? Unsure what I mean by that, but it seems to me right now that the most important thing is settling into her role and then carrying it out to the best of your abilities?

More thought as it develops I suppose.
