# Why?

Just for now let's say I have identified these three themes as being important (more in the process journal)

- _Service_ - a game about being in service to someone else (the audience) and losing your ego as a player/Marina Abramovic.

- _Inversion_ - a game about the inversion of another game, switching two key roles, ultimately requiring at least some asymmetry for meaning-making

- _Remediation_ - a game about the remediation of body and space (as media that create a performance artwork) into the logic of a digital game (via the book Remediation obviously)
