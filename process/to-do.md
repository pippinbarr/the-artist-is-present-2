# Okay now we need actual to dos

## Title
- Guess it needs a title screen?

## Dialogs
- ~~Add painting information dialogs~~
- ~~Instructions for looking down and up~~
- Ticket person
- Entry guard
- Queue members
- Queue guards
- Double check all required places have dialog

## Queue behavior
- ~~Create a function to send the front person in the queue to go sit in the chair and the rest of the queue to move up. Add a new person to the (invisible) end of the queue so it doesn't end (is this cheating?)~~
- ~~Fix depth issues around the chair~~
- ~~Trigger first sitter when marina looks up~~
- ~~Calculate timer for duration of sitting (use the original game)~~
- ~~On timer end have them stand and walk away (just stage right is fine)~~
- ~~Show message telling marina any key to look down again~~

## First person view
- ~~Trigger an overlay when looking at someone so you can stay in the same scene~~
- Consider random weeping (prototype it)
- Consider blinking (replace eye area with their skin color, which I suppose we have access to somewhere in there? Or can.)

## Timing
- Infinite timing issues


# Generalllllll

- ~~Collect images from the documentary of relevant spaces~~
- ~~Start an actual Phaser project (let's not bother with mobile? Or very lightly contemplate click-based interaction I suppose)~~
- ~~Import a walk cycle~~
- ~~Contemplate using a sprite atlas instead of the current madness?~~
- ~~Build a "simple" walking around scene~~
- ~~Add an object collision with hitboxes etc.~~
- ~~Contemplate sprite recolouring issue~~
- ~~Contemplate how to do room-shape collisions~~
- ~~Build a dialog box object/function (guess it could just extend sprite)~~
