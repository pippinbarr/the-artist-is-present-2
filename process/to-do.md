# Generalllllll

- ~~Collect images from the documentary of relevant spaces~~
- ~~Start an actual Phaser project (let's not bother with mobile? Or very lightly contemplate click-based interaction I suppose)~~
- ~~Import a walk cycle~~
- ~~Contemplate using a sprite atlas instead of the current madness?~~
- ~~Build a "simple" walking around scene~~

- Contemplate sprite recolouring issue
- Add collisions (think about how to represent environment collisions)
- Build a dialog box object/function (guess it could just extend sprite)
